# Borg Research Group
This is the first Borg research project to explore the possibility of merging human with machines. 
I have always been fascinated with this sentence from StarTrek,
**"We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile."**
Their ability to learn, mutate in better version always fascinated my intellectural curiosity. Would be possible even for a fraction of it, being able to live in synbiosis with a machine? Let's find it out.
