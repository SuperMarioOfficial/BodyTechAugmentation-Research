# Borg Research Group
This is the first Borg research project to explore the possibility of merging human with machines. 
I have always been fascinated with this sentence from StarTrek,
"We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile."
Their ability to learn, mutate in better version always fascinated my intellectural curiosity. Would be possible even for a fraction of it, being able to live in synbiosis with a machine? Let's find it out.
